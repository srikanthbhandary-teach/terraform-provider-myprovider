## 1. Running the Local Server

The local server manages data entities and exposes HTTP APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting these entities.

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine

### Steps

1. Clone the server repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srikanthbhandary-teach/my-server.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. The server will start and be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## 2. Setting Up Local Development for Terraform

To develop and test your custom Terraform provider locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine

### Steps

1. Clone the custom Terraform provider repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srikanthbhandary-teach/myprovider.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the provider directory:

   ```bash
   cd myprovider
   ```

3. Install the custom Terraform provider using Go modules:

   ```bash
   go install github.com/srikanthbhandary-teach/myprovider@latest
   ```

4. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   This command initializes the Terraform configuration and verifies the custom provider's installation.

## 3. Using the Custom Terraform Provider

To use the custom Terraform provider, you'll first need to install it.

### Prerequisites

- Terraform installed on your machine

### Steps

1. **Install the Custom Terraform Provider:**

   Run the following command to download and install the custom Terraform provider using Go modules:

   ```bash
   go install github.com/srikanthbhandary-teach/myprovider@latest
   ```

2. **Verify the Installation:**

   Ensure that the custom provider is installed and accessible by running:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

   This command initializes the Terraform configuration and verifies the custom provider's installation.

3. **Use the Custom Provider:**

   In your Terraform configuration, specify the custom provider in the `terraform` block:

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       myprovider = {
         source = "github.com/srikanthbhandary-teach/myprovider"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Use the provider in your resources and data sources.

## 4. Terraform Examples

Here are some examples of using the custom Terraform provider:

```hcl
data "myprovider_users" "example" {
  filter = {
    name = "srikanth"
    id   = 10
    age  = 20
  }
}

output "myprovider_users" {
  value = data.myprovider_users.example.users
}

resource "myprovider_user" "user1" {
  name = "srikanth1"
  age  = 30
  id   = 11
}
```
