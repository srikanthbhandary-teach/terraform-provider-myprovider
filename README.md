# Custom Terraform Provider: "myprovider"

## Introduction

The "myprovider" custom Terraform provider is designed to interact with the HashiCups API for managing `MyInfo` entities. It offers seamless integration with Terraform, enabling users to provision and manage `MyInfo` instances effectively.

## Terraform Integration

The "myprovider" Terraform provider allows users to define and manage `MyInfo` entities within their Terraform configurations. This integration enhances the infrastructure as code (IaC) experience, enabling the provisioning and management of `MyInfo` entities alongside other infrastructure components.

## Server Functionalities

The "myprovider" custom Terraform provider is backed by a server application that provides the following functionalities:

### Managing `MyInfo` Entities

The server is responsible for managing `MyInfo` entities, where each entity represents information about an entity with properties like `ID`, `Name`, and `Age`.

- **Adding `MyInfo` Entity**: The server allows adding a new `MyInfo` entity or updating an existing one using the `AddMyInfo` method.

- **Getting `MyInfo` Entity by ID**: The `GetMyInfo` method retrieves a `MyInfo` entity based on its unique ID.

- **Getting All `MyInfo` Entities**: The `GetAllMyInfo` method fetches all available `MyInfo` entities.

- **Deleting `MyInfo` Entity by ID**: The `DeleteMyInfo` method deletes a `MyInfo` entity based on its ID.

- **Updating `MyInfo` Entity by ID**: The `UpdateMyInfo` method updates an existing `MyInfo` entity based on its ID.

### HTTP APIs for CRUD Operations

The server exposes HTTP APIs to interact with the `MyInfo` entities, allowing for basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Creating a `MyInfo` Entity**: A `POST` request to the appropriate endpoint with the `MyInfo` entity data allows creating a new `MyInfo` entity.

- **Retrieving a `MyInfo` Entity**: A `GET` request to the appropriate endpoint with the `MyInfo` entity's ID retrieves the `MyInfo` entity.

- **Updating a `MyInfo` Entity**: A `PUT` request to the appropriate endpoint with the `MyInfo` entity's ID and updated data updates the `MyInfo` entity.

- **Deleting a `MyInfo` Entity**: A `DELETE` request to the appropriate endpoint with the `MyInfo` entity's ID deletes the `MyInfo` entity.

## Usage

To utilize the "myprovider" custom Terraform provider and leverage the server functionalities, follow the steps outlined below.

### Example Usage

#### Provider Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    myprovider = {
      source = "github.com/srikanthbhandary-teach/myprovider"
    }
  }
}

provider "myprovider" {
  apikey = "myAppSecret12254"
}
```

In this example, we define the "myprovider" Terraform provider and configure its API key.

#### Data Source - Fetching Users

```hcl
data "myprovider_users" "example" {
  filter = {
    name = "srikanth"
    id = 10
    age = 20
  }
}

output "myprovider_users" {
  value = data.myprovider_users.example.users
}
```

Here, we retrieve users based on the specified filters for `name`, `id`, and `age`, and output the users' information.

#### Resource - Creating a User

```hcl
resource "myprovider_user" "user1" {
  name = "srikanth1"
  age = 30
  id = 11
}
```

This block defines a resource to create a user with the specified `name`, `age`, and `id`.

For more details on using this provider and leveraging the server functionalities, refer to the usage documentation.
